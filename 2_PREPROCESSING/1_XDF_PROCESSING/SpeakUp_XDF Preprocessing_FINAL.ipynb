    "### CODE OVERVIEW\n",
    "This script is designed to process XDF files, extract data streams, perform renaming and clipping operations, and save the processed data in CSV and WAV formats. The script is structured into several key sections, each performing specific tasks, from importing necessary packages to processing the data and saving the output. Below is a detailed breakdown of each section of the code: \n",
    "\n",
    "0. **Packages**\n",
    "      This section imports all the necessary libraries and modules used throughout the script. These include modules for file handling, data manipulation, audio processing, video processing, plotting, and GUI interaction.\n",
    "     See requirements.txt for all necessary packages (pip install -r requirements.txt)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Variables**\n",
    "     Users defines the input and output directories for XDF files and result outputs\n",
    "     - **noise_reducelevel**  Sets the level for noise reduction in audio processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **extension_to_codec = { ... }**  Maps different file extensions to their corresponding codecs for video processing.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - **rename_dict = { ... }** This dictionary is used to rename certain data streams based on their name and type.\n",
    "        !! **this dictionary should be adjusted or removed according to the user xdf file**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Functions**\n",
    "    - to_audio: Converts time-series data into a WAV audio file.\n",
    "    - frame_to_time: Converts frame numbers to time format (HH:MM.SS).\n",
    "    - rename_streams: Renames streams based on the provided dictionary.\n",
    "    - clip_nonmarker_streams: Clips the start and end of streams based on the shortest stream, excluding marker streams.\n",
    "    - get_events: Extracts specified events from a marker stream.     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identifying XDF Files**\n",
    "   - Method 1. Automatically identifying XDF files in the input directory and its subdirectories by traverses the input directory to find all files with the .xdf extension and adds them to the xdf_files list\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Method 2.  Manually selecting XDF files using a GUI dialog. Provides an alternative way to manually select XDF files using a graphical file selection dialog.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3.  **Identifying XDF Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "Loading and Renaming Streams: Loads the XDF file and renames streams based on the predefined dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clipping Streams: Clips streams to ensure they all start and end at the same time, based on non-marker streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processing Each Stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extracts and formats data from each stream.\n",
    "Saves the data as CSV files.\n",
    "Special handling for microphone streams, including saving as WAV files and performing noise reduction.\n",
    "Subfolder Creation: Automatically creates a subfolder for each XDF file based on its name and saves the processed data inside.\n",
